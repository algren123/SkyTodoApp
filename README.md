# Sky Todo App

This project outlines a very basic Todo App to showcase React state and working in the way of React. Didn't want to go too in-depth with the code and instead focus on in-class questions and debugging. The app features the Creation of a todo item, the ability to Read it and to Delete it. If you enjoyed this and would like to learn more React, I would suggest adding the following to this project:

- Ability to Update a todo item
- Introducing Unique IDS of each item
- Logic-based styling
- Session storage (save in the user's browser session)
- Persistent storage (save in database)
